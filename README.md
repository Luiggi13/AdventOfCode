# Advent of Code 2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# Current Dates

## Day 1 ~ Completed

### Part 1

The Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up. Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

### Part 2

The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria. In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?

## Day 2 - Completed

### Part 1

The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if you can take a look. Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen. To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set. Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. How many passwords are valid according to their policies?

### Part 2

The shopkeeper suddenly realizes that he just accidentally explained the password policy rules from his old job at the sled rental place down the street! The Official Toboggan Corporate Policy actually works a little differently. Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!) Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement. How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?

## Day 3 - Completed

### Part 1

With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees. The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1. From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map. Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?

### Part 2

Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all. Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

- Right 1, down 1.
- Right 3, down 1. *(This is the slope you already checked.)*
- Right 5, down 1.
- Right 7, down 1.
- Right 1, down 2.

What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?

## Day 4 - Completed

### Part 1

You arrive at the airport only to realize that you grabbed your North Pole Credentials instead of your passport. While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world. It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary. Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields. Treat cid as optional. The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows:

- byr (Birth Year)
- iyr (Issue Year)
- eyr (Expiration Year)
- hgt (Height)
- hcl (Hair Color)
- ecl (Eye Color)
- pid (Passport ID)
- cid (Country ID)

In your batch file, how many passports are valid? 

### Part 2

The line is moving more quickly now, but you overhear airport security talking about how passports with invalid data are getting through. Better add some data validation, quick! You can continue to ignore the cid field, but each other field has strict rules about what values are valid for automatic validation:

- byr (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.
- iyr (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.
- eyr (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.
- hgt (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
  - If cm, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
  - If in, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
- hcl (Hair Color) - a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.
- ecl (Eye Color) - exactly one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.
- pid (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.
- cid (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.

Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields and valid values. Continue to treat cid as optional. In your batch file, how many passports are valid?
